۞ يَـٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ خُذُوا۟ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍۢ وَكُلُوا۟ وَٱشْرَبُوا۟ وَلَا تُسْرِفُوٓا۟ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلْمُسْرِفِينَ ٣١

Children of Adam! Take your adornment at every time of Prayer;1 and eat and drink without going to excesses. For Allah does not like those who go to excess.

وَءَاتِ ذَا ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ حَقَّهُۥ وَٱلْمِسْكِينَ وَٱبْنَ ٱلسَّبِيلِ وَلَا تُبَذِّرْ تَبْذِيرًا ٢٦

(iii) Give to the near of kin his due, and also to the needy and the wayfarer. (iv) Do not squander your wealth wastefully,

إِنَّ ٱلْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوٓا۟ إِخْوَٰنَ ٱلشَّيَـٰطِينِ ۖ وَكَانَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنُ لِرَبِّهِۦ كَفُورًۭا ٢٧
for those who squander wastefully are Satan's brothers, and Satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.


"And when We decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allâh and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its population] who lead a life of luxury. Then, they transgress therein, and thus then word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction." (Surah Baqara, 102)

Ibn Umar, radhi Allahu anhu, said: "I heard the Prophet say 'If people withhold (hoard) dinars and dirham and trade according to al-eena (a type of trade which is similar to riba) and they follow the tails of the cows and leave the Jihad in the Path of Allah, Allah places upon them humiliation which will not be raised from them until they return to their deen.'"

Whoever relieves a Muslim of a worldly distress, Allah will relieve him of a distress on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever eases [the way for] a destitute person, Allah will ease [the way for] him in this world and the Hereafter. Whoever covers a Muslim (fault), Allah will cover him in this world and the Hereafter. Allah will help His slave as long as the slave helps his brother. Whoever travels a path in search of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise. No people gather in one of the Houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, but tranquility descends upon them, mercy covers them, angels surround them, and Allah mentions them among those who are with Him. And whoever is slowed down by his deeds, his lineage will not hasten him."

Hadith on the Worth of the World to Allah: Sahl ibn Sa’d reported that the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم said, "If the world were as worthy to Allah as the wing of a mosquito, an unbeliever would not even be given a sip of water." 

"Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment.

Tariq ibn Shihab reported that Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, said, "Verily, we were a disgraceful people and Allah honored us with Islam. If we seek honor from anything besides that with which Allah honored us, Allah will disgrace us."’

"What I fear for you most is what you will compete for, and it will ruin you just as it ruined them." (Sahih Bukhari, 2988)

"If anyone loves for Allāh’s sake, hates for Allāh’s sake, gives for Allāh’s sake and withholds for Allāh’s sake, he will have perfect faith." 

“There is no obedience in disobedience (to Allāh), obedience is only in goodness.
