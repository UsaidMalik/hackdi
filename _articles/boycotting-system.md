# Why We Boycott the System, Not Just the Brands

*This article is adapted from Section 2.3 of the book "Islamic Boycotts in the Context of Modern War."*

A common—and limited—approach to boycotting is to focus on a handful of high-profile, pro-Zionist corporations. A Muslim stops buying from an American brand and switches to a brand from a Muslim country, believing the problem is solved. This understanding is incomplete.

Consider this example: A Muslim boycotts Danone (a Western brand) and buys yogurt from Almarai (a Saudi brand). On the surface, this seems good. But where does Almarai's money go?
- It owns farms in the United States to source grass for its cows.
- Its automated milking equipment is sourced from Western nations.
- It holds accounts in international banks and uses Western insurance, embedding its capital into the global *ribā* system.
- The taxes its owners and the company itself pay in various jurisdictions ultimately support Western and allied governments.

The owners of such large corporations live nearly identical lifestyles, purchasing Western luxury goods, educating their children in Western universities, and investing their wealth back into the Western financial system. They are, willingly or unwillingly, cogs in the same machine.

### The Real Target: The Zionist-Dominated Financial System

The main tool of control over the Muslim world is the global economic system. It is a financial alliance of mutual support, including:
- Central banks and national currencies (like the US Dollar).
- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.
- Stock exchanges and interbank lending networks.
- Insurance companies and credit rating agencies.

These institutions form a single body. If one part is hit by a boycott, the system moves resources to support it. Therefore, focusing on a few brands is like trying to fight an octopus by cutting off the tip of one tentacle. To be effective, we must target the entire body.

Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says:

> **وَقَاتِلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ كَافَّةً كَمَا يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ كَافَّةً ۚ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ**
>
> And fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively. And know that Allah is with the righteous [who fear Him]. (Surah at-Tawba, 36)

The *kuffār* boycott us collectively. When they sanction an Islamic movement, they sanction everyone involved. Our response must be reciprocal. The goal is not just to punish a few companies, but to begin the long and noble process of **withdrawing from their system** and building our own. This is why our method encourages moving towards local food, home production, and alternative economies, as these actions strike at the root of the system itself.
