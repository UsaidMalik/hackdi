# Mutammimah al-Ajurrumiyyah Lecture Notes #34: The Sisters of كان and أفعال المقاربة

## I. Remaining Rulings for كان and its Sisters

### A. The Position of the خبر (Predicate)

The placement of the خبر in sentences with مَا دَامَ and مَا النَّافِيَة has specific rules.

#### 1. With مَا دَامَ

The خبر of دَامَ cannot precede مَا.
*   **Example Sentence:** مَا دَامَ زَيْدٌ عَالِمًا (For as long as Zayd is a scholar).
*   **Rule:** It is not permissible to say عَالِمًا مَا دَامَ زَيْدٌ. The consensus on this is captured in the line of poetry: وَكُلٌّ سَبْقَهُ دَامَ حَظَرْ (Everyone has forbidden the precedence [of the khabar] over dāma).
*   **Second Point:** It is also not permissible to place the خبر between مَا and دَامَ. One cannot say مَا عَالِمًا دَامَ زَيْدٌ.

#### 2. With مَا النَّافِيَة (The مَا of Negation)

When مَا of negation precedes كَانَ (e.g., مَا كَانَ زَيْدٌ فَاضِلًا), there are two scenarios regarding the position of the خبر.

*   **Scenario 1: Can the خبر precede مَا?**
    *   **Example:** Can مَا كَانَ زَيْدٌ فَاضِلًا become فَاضِلًا مَا كَانَ زَيْدٌ?
    *   **The Kūfiyyūn:** They permit this.
    *   **The Baṣriyyūn:** They **do not** permit this. Their reasoning is that مَا of negation requires صَدَارَة (to be at the beginning of the sentence).

*   **Scenario 2: Can the خبر precede كَانَ (but remain after مَا)?**
    *   **Example:** Can مَا كَانَ زَيْدٌ فَاضِلًا become _________?
    *   **Ruling:** The majority of scholars permit this.

> **Note:** If the negation is with a particle other than مَا (e.g., لَا), such as in لَا يَكُونُ زَيْدٌ فَاضِلًا, there is consensus that the خبر can be brought forward (فَاضِلًا لَا يَكُونُ زَيْدٌ). The disagreement is specific to مَا.

### B. Dropping the ن of كَانَ

A unique characteristic of كَانَ is the permissibility of dropping the final ن from its مضارع مجزوم form (يَكُنْ becomes يَكُ). This is permissible only if four conditions are met:

1.  The verb must be in the _________ (jussive) mood.
2.  The verb must be in the _________ tense.
3.  It must not be followed by a letter with a _________ (sākin).
4.  It must not be followed by a _________ (ḍamīr naṣb).

*   **Example from the Qur'an:** وَلَمْ أَكُ بَغِيًّا (I was not an unchaste woman). The original form is أَكُنْ. The ن is dropped because all four conditions are met.
*   **Benefits in بلاغة:** Dropping the ن can imply:
    *   تقليل الوقت: That the action did not happen even for the briefest moment.
    *   _________: That the very existence or being of the thing is minimal.

## II. The Letters Resembling ليس

These are particles that operate like ليس by making the اسم مرفوع and the خبر منصوب. They are called الحروف المشبّهة بليس.

*   **Why do they resemble ليس and not كَانَ?**
    1.  **Shared Meaning:** They all share the meaning of negation, just like ليس.
    2.  **Strict Conditions:** They require specific conditions to operate, making them "weaker" than كَانَ, similar to how ليس is a rigid, non-flexible verb.

There are four such letters: _________, _________, _________, and _________.

### A. مَا (The مَا of Hijāz)

مَا operates like ليس according to the dialect of the _________. The people of بنو تميم do not have it operate this way; for them, the words following it remain مبتدأ and خبر. For مَا to operate, four conditions must be met:

1.  It must not be followed by the extra particle _________.
2.  The خبر must not be followed by _________.
3.  The _________ must not precede the _________.
4.  The معمول الخبر (the object/adverb governed by the predicate) must not precede the اسم, **unless** it is a _________ or a _________.

*   **Example:** مَا هَٰذَا بَشَرًا (This is not a man). بَشَرًا is منصوب because the conditions are met.
*   **Example of a Broken Condition:** مَا قَائِمٌ زَيْدٌ. Here, the خبر (قَائِمٌ) precedes the اسم (زَيْدٌ), so مَا no longer operates, and both words are مرفوع.

### B. لَا

لَا operates like ليس with the same four conditions as مَا, plus one additional condition.

*   **Fifth Condition:** The اسم and the خبر must both be _________ (indefinite).
*   **Example:** لَا رَجُلٌ أَفْضَلَ مِنْكَ (No man is better than you).
*   **Difference of Opinion:** The Baṣriyyūn uphold this fifth condition. However, the Kūfiyyūn and Ibn Mālik allow لَا to operate even if the اسم and خبر are معرفة (definite).

### C. إِنْ

إِنْ operates like ليس with the same four conditions as مَا.

*   **Example:** إِنْ أَحَدٌ خَيْرًا مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِالْعَافِيَةِ (No one is better than anyone except through well-being).
*   **Important Distinction:** This إِنْ of negation must be differentiated from إِنْ المخففة من المثقلة (the lightened version of إِنَّ). The lightened إِنْ is followed by a _________ on its predicate, as in إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَقَائِمٌ (Indeed, Zayd is standing).

### D. لَاتَ

لَاتَ is a unique particle that operates like ليس but with its own strict conditions:

1.  Its اسم and خبر must be words indicating _________ (e.g., حِين, وَقْت).
2.  Either the _________ or the _________ must be omitted (usually the اسم).

*   **Example from the Qur'an:** وَلَاتَ حِينَ مَنَاصٍ (And it was not a time of escape).
*   **The Full Implied Sentence:** وَلَاتَ الْحِينُ حِينَ مَنَاصٍ (The time was not a time of escape). The اسم (الْحِينُ) has been omitted.

## III. The Verbs of Approach (أفعال المقاربة)

These verbs operate like كَانَ, but their خبر is almost always a جملة فعلية (a verbal sentence). They are divided into three types:

1.  **Verbs of Nearness (_________):** Indicate the action is *about to happen*.
    *   Examples: _________, _________, _________.
2.  **Verbs of Hope (_________):** Indicate *hope* for the action to happen.
    *   Examples: _________, _________, _________.
3.  **Verbs of Beginning (_________):** Indicate the *beginning* of the action.
    *   Examples: _________, _________, _________.

### The Rule of أَنْ with the خبر

The main distinguishing feature of these verbs is the rule regarding whether their خبر (the verbal sentence) is preceded by the particle أَنْ.

*   **The General Logic:**
    *   **Verbs of Beginning (أفعال الشروع):** The action is happening now (present). أَنْ makes a verb future-tense. Therefore, it is illogical to use أَنْ.
    *   **Verbs of Hope (أفعال الرجاء):** Hope is for the future. Therefore, it is logical to use أَنْ.
    *   **Verbs of Nearness (أفعال المقاربة):** The action is in the near future, close to the present. Therefore, using أَنْ is less common.

#### Specific Rulings

1.  **Obligatory to use أَنْ:**
    *   With the verbs _________ and _________.
    *   Example: حَرَى زَيْدٌ أَنْ يَقُومَ

2.  **Obligatory to Omit أَنْ:**
    *   With all the _________.
    *   Example: وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ

3.  **Most Common to use أَنْ:**
    *   With the verbs _________ and _________.
    *   Example: فَعَسَى اللَّهُ أَنْ يَأْتِيَ بِالْفَتْحِ

4.  **Most Common to Omit أَنْ:**
    *   With the verbs _________ and _________.
    *   Example: فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ
