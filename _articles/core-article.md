# Our Method: A Boycott for the Sake of Allah

All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all worlds. This platform is not just another boycott list. It is an attempt to answer a fundamental question for the modern Muslim: How do we navigate a world where our very economic activity—our jobs, our purchases, our savings—is used to strengthen a global system at war with Islam?

Our methodology is directly inspired by the book *Islamic Boycotts in the Context of Modern War*. It is built on a framework that goes far beyond simply swapping one brand for another. This is our *'aqīdah* (creed) of economic action:

### 1. The Target is the System, Not Just the Tentacles

The first and most crucial understanding is that our boycott targets the entire **Zionist-dominated, ribā-based global order**. Individual corporations like Starbucks or McDonald's are merely the visible tentacles of a much larger entity. This system wages a multifaceted war against the Ummah:
- **Militarily:** By funding and arming hostile states.
- **Economically:** By trapping Muslim nations in debt and dependency through institutions like the IMF and World Bank.
- **Culturally:** By promoting consumerism, shamelessness (*tabarruj*), deviancy (LGBTQ+), and the destruction of the Muslim family.

Switching from an American cola to a Saudi-owned cola might seem like a victory, but as the book illustrates, that Saudi company often uses the same Western banks, insurance, supply chains, and advertising models, ultimately feeding the same system. Our goal is systemic withdrawal.

### 2. The Pinnacle is *Zuhd* (Asceticism), Not Mere Consumer Choice

For every product category, the highest and most beloved path is not finding a "halal alternative," but **eliminating the need for the product altogether**. This is the principle of *zuhd* (asceticism), a forgotten sunnah.
- **Food:** Before asking for an alternative to Domino's Pizza, we ask: "Why are we not cooking wholesome food at home, as our mothers and grandmothers did?" The pinnacle path is home-cooking.
- **Clothing:** Before seeking an alternative to Western brands, we ask: "Why do we chase fleeting fashions?" The pinnacle path is minimalism, mending our clothes, and embracing modest Islamic attire.

This platform will always present *zuhd* and self-sufficiency as the Grade-A, top-tier option. It is an act of worship that purifies the soul and starves the enemy.

### 3. Our Reasons are Comprehensive and Islamic

While we stand in complete solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Palestine, our boycott is not limited to the BDS movement's criteria. We will identify and target entities for any action that constitutes a war on Allah and His Messenger ﷺ. This includes:
- Overt promotion of LGBTQ+ ideology.
- Using "soft prostitution" (*tabarruj*) in advertising.
- Waging war on Islamic values and the family structure.
- Polluting the earth, which is a trust from Allah.

### 4. This is an Act of Worship (*'Ibādah*)

Every search on this app, every conscious decision to abstain from a purchase, must be done with the correct *niyyah* (intention): to seek the pleasure of Allah by weakening His enemies and strengthening the Ummah. This transforms a mundane act into a weighty deed on our scales.

We ask Allah to accept this effort and to make it a means for the Muslims to regain their honor and independence.
