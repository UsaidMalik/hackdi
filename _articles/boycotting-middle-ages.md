# Answering the Doubts: "Will Boycotting Take Us Back to the Middle Ages?"

*This article is adapted from Section 5.7 of the book "Islamic Boycotts in the Context of Modern War."*

A common argument against a comprehensive boycott is that it will lead to a loss in our standard of living, throwing us "back to the Middle Ages" by cutting us off from Western technology and "progress." This fear is a cornerstone of the psychological warfare used to keep the Ummah in a state of subjugation. To dismantle this doubt, we must ask ourselves two questions.

### First, What is the Purpose of Life?

The purpose of our existence is not to achieve the highest material standard of living. It is to worship Allah. Allah *subḥānahu wa ta`ālā* says:

> **وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ**
>
> And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. (Surah adh-Dhariya, 56)

Is a high degree of economic cooperation with the West necessary for the correct worship of Allah? Does Western technology truly help us in our worship? The reality is that modern lifestyles often leave us with *less* time for worship, as we work longer hours to pay for unnecessary luxuries. The "necessities" of modern life, like cars, are often only necessary because we have adopted un-Islamic models of city planning that were designed to enrich oil companies.

### Second, Is "Progress" Truly a Net Good?

The idea that Western technology has unequivocally improved the human condition is a carefully crafted myth. While there are some apparent benefits, they come at a tremendous cost:

-   **Environmental Pollution:** Modern industry is a leading cause of cancers and autoimmune diseases, and it devastates the natural world Allah entrusted to us.
-   **Moral Problems:** The entire technological-industrial complex was built upon *ribā* (usury), an act of war against Allah. It is impossible for something fundamentally good to emerge from something so evil.
-   **Social Problems:** The system requires extreme inequality and leads to the breakdown of family and community.
-   **Health Problems:** Modern lifestyles have created an epidemic of "diseases of affluence" like diabetes, heart disease, and depression. We have more food, but it is less nutritious. We live longer, but not as fully.
-   **Dependency:** This technology creates profound dependency, making us vulnerable. Reliance on industrial agriculture, for example, leaves populations susceptible to famine if supply chains are disrupted.

The truth is that wealthy elites in the West now spend fortunes trying to escape their own "progress"—buying organic food, traveling to remote areas to escape noise and pollution, and seeking extreme sports to feel alive.

The technological order of this civilization is not permanent, just as the mighty civilizations of the past, with their own impressive technologies, have all turned to dust. Fearing the loss of this technology is a failure to trust in Allah and His decree (*qadr*). True progress is not measured in material wealth, but in closeness to Allah, and true strength is not found in dependence on our enemies, but in dignified self-sufficiency.
